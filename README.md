Google Analytics Plugin
==============

You have many players on your Minecraft server but you might wonder who is
playing from which location. This plugin allows to collect information about the 
players, like locations and actions using 
[Google Analytics](http://www.google.de/analytics/) as a simple 
[Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) plugin.


This page contains the source of the plugin, but if you simply want to add it tou your Minecraft server, check it out at [Bukkit Dev](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/googleanalyticsplugin/).


# Contribution

I don't have time to improve the plugin at the moment, but I'm happy if you 
contribute to the project. Create a pull request and I will merge it into the 
project. I will also keep uploading the new versions to the gallery on dev.bukkit.com 
to allow others to benefit from your contributions.

considered:
